These certificates are copied from https://github.com/ConsultingMD/paloaltonetworks/tree/master/certs

They are used by the GlobalProtect VPN DLP MITM inspector.

If these certs expire John Walsh is probably the person to talk to.

The mozilla.pem file contains all the certs from
along with the DLP certs for the VPN, so it should be comprehensive
enough to work as a CA bundle whether you're on the VPN or not.
